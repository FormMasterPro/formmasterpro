        <p>FormMasterPro ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our FormMasterPro browser extension ("the Software").

          <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>FormMasterPro is designed with privacy in mind. We collect the following information to provide our service:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> When you create an account or log in, we collect information through our authentication provider (Auth0) including email address and subscription information.</li>
            <li><strong>Form Data:</strong> The extension processes form field data on web pages to facilitate form filling. This data is primarily processed locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Document Content:</strong> When you upload documents (such as DOCX files) for form filling assistance, we process this content to extract relevant information.</li>
            <li><strong>API Communications:</strong> When using AI suggestions, your form field data and processed user profile information are sent to our secure API service.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> We collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the Software, such as which features are most commonly used.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Reports:</strong> If you choose to send error reports, we collect information about the error and your system configuration to help diagnose and fix issues.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> While your form data and document content are primarily processed locally, certain features like AI form filling suggestions require transmitting processed data to our secure servers. Your email verification status is checked when accessing certain features. We implement security measures to protect any data transmitted to our servers.</p>
