        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>FormMasterPro was born out of frustration with the repetitive nature of filling out online forms. As developers and frequent web users, we found ourselves constantly re-entering the same information across countless websites and applications.</p>
        
        <p>In 2022, we set out to solve this problem once and for all. Our goal was to create an intelligent tool that would not only automate form filling but adapt to the wide variety of form structures found across the web.</p>
        
        <p>After months of development, testing, and refinement, FormMasterPro emerged as a powerful solution that combines AI-driven field recognition with intelligent data mapping to make form filling effortless.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is simple: to eliminate the tedious task of manual form filling and give people back their valuable time.</p>
        
        <p>We believe that technology should reduce friction in our daily lives, not add to it. By automating repetitive tasks like form filling, we free up time for more meaningful activities and reduce the cognitive load of navigating the modern web.</p>
